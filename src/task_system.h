// This provides a compile-time abstraction over concurrency management.
// A custom implementation of the .cpp file can be provided if needed.
//
// The goal is to give the user full control over which tasks run on
// which thread, ensuring total ownership over the program's execution
// without requiring the re-implementation of basic routines that are
// handled concurrently. For example, a user shouldn't have to rewrite
// internal logic like automatic import fetching or dependency resolution
// just to use specific threading rules or an existing thread pool.
//
// This keeps the compiler coherent while granting the freedom to
// decide exactly how and where the work happens based on specific needs.
