# Installation
To install plugin/extension locally use .vsix file provided within each directory.
There are two ways:
## using cmd
code --install-extension <whatever_file_you_choose>.vsix
(code has to be in PATH, usually set up automatically during the VS-Code installation)
## through VS-Code itself
open VS-Code, open command menu (Ctrl+Shift+P by default), type 'Install from VSIX' and select one you want to install
